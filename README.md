# Panic3D
An HTML5 project I am currently working on using the Three.js framework, mainly acting as a learning project to try and push my knowledge of JavaScript as a whole. This project does require a decent graphical processor as well as ECMAScript 6 and WebGL.

    * A great place to get started with some awesome examples
